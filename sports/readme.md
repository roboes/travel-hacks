[apple_health_export_tools.py](apple_health_export_tools.py) is a script that performs a series of transformations to the [Apple Health .xml Export](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/share-your-health-data-iph5ede58c3d/ios). The main features are:

- Import Apple Health workouts/activities to a DataFrame and convert/save them as .tcx files (to upload to Strava).

### Python dependencies

```.ps1
python -m pip install numpy pandas python-dateutil
```

## Garmin Data Export Tools

### Usage

[garmin_data_export_tools.py](garmin_data_export_tools.py) is a script that performs a series of transformations to the [Garmin Data Export Request](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/account/datamanagement/exportdata/). The main features are:
